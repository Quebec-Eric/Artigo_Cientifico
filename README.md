## Directory Structure

  - `Clustering/`: Notebooks and scripts dedicated to clustering techniques applied to data.
  - `DBSCAN/`: Specific analysis using the DBSCAN algorithm.
  - `KMeans/`: Specific analysis using the KMeans algorithm.
  - `Som/`: Specific analysis using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM).

  
`Models/`: Notebooks that deal with the application of machine learning models in addition to clustering methods.


- `Pre_Processing/`: Scripts and notebooks dedicated to pre-processing data, preparing it for subsequent analysis.
  - `Base_Crimes/`: Pre-processing of crime data.
  - `Base_parks/`: Pre-processing of park data.
  - `Base_SexOffenders/`: Pre-processing data on sexual offenders.
  - `IntegracaoDasBases/`: Final pre-processing of the ready base..

- `Visualization/`: Notebooks that contain visualizations of data and analysis results.
